# Tello-Drone-qrcode-barcode-scanner
This project allows voice-controlled operation of a Tello drone using the djitello library and Vosk voice recognition. It enables commands like "Take off" and "Land," while the drone can also scan QR codes and barcodes with its camera. The content of detected codes is displayed in real-time during flight.
