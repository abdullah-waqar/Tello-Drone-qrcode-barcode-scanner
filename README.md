# Tello-Drone-qrcode-barcode-scanner
This project allows voice-controlled operation of a Tello drone using the djitello library and Vosk voice recognition. It enables commands like "Take off" and "Land," while the drone can also scan QR codes and barcodes with its camera. The content of detected codes is displayed in real-time during flight.

Key Features:

Voice Control:
Control the drone with simple voice commands such as:
"Take off" to make the drone take off.
"Land" to make the drone land safely.

Barcode/QRCode Scanning:
The drone can detect and read QR codes and barcodes using its onboard camera. When detected, the content is displayed for the user to see.

Real-time Feedback:
The drone's camera feed is used to scan the environment, providing immediate results when a barcode or QR code is detected.
